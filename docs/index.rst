Features
--------

handroll follows a *"batteries included"* philosophy for generating static
websites. One goal is to support a wide range of tools to cater to many diverse
interests. The list below isn't exhaustive, but it provides a good idea of
what handroll is capable of doing.

* Copy static assets like CSS or JavaScript.
* Convert `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_ to HTML.
* Convert `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ to
  HTML.
* Convert `Textile <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile>`_ to HTML.
* Generate a proper `Atom XML
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29>`_ feed from metadata
  stored in JSON.
* Be extensible for users who want to write their own plugins.

The remaining documentation provides additional details about all listed
features.
