Translation
===========

For Translators
---------------

Translation for handroll is done on handroll's `Transifex project
<https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/handroll/>`_. All contributions from any
language are welcome. The project should be configured to automatically accept
requests to join the translation team.

Translators will be added to the AUTHORS list of contributors for contributions
of any size (unless you specifically do not want to be listed).

If you have any problems, please feel free to `report an issue on Github
<https://github.com/handroll/handroll/issues/new>`_. If there is a new
language that you want to translate for, please file an issue so it can be
added (there is a small amount of software setup to make a new language work
with handroll).

For Developers
--------------

All user interface strings (aside from flag names) should be translated.
Strings are wrapped in a conventional way for gettext using the alias ``_``.
The gettext method is configured in the ``handroll.i18n`` module. Any new code
would use that method for strings. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from handroll.i18n import _

    translated = _('This string is translated.')

The ``handroll.pot`` file is the template that the translators use as the basis
for translation. handroll uses `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org/>`_ to generate
the ``pot`` file. A new ``pot`` file is generated by executing
``python setup.py extract_messages``. The updated ``pot`` file is automatically
synced to Transifex after it is pushed to GitHub.

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

Download the ``po`` files. The ``mo`` files are automatically generated with
the ``sdist`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python transifex.py
    $ python setup.py sdist
